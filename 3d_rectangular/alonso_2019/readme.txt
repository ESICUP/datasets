DESCRIPTION:
Test problems used in M.T. Alonso, R. Alvarez-Valdes, M. Iori, F. Parre√±o, Mathematical models for Multi Container Loading Problems with practical constraints, Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 127, 2019, Pages 722-733, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2018.11.012
The problem deals with a number of layers demanded for a specific day. 
The layers have to be stacked in pallets and the pallets are loaded into trucks according to the day demanded.
These instances have been provided courtesy by ORTEC.

STRUCTURE:
