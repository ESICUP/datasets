# Academic Cutting & Packing Datasets from the ESICUP community
This repository contains a collection of datasets for academic research in cutting and packing problems. The datasets are intended to facilitate benchmarking and comparison of different algorithms and approaches.

> [!NOTE]
> This resource was previously hosted at [https://github.com/ESICUP/datasets](https://github.com/ESICUP/datasets), but has been migrated to GitHub in an effort to improve maintainability and long-term availability.

## Structure

The datasets are organized into subdirectories based on the dimensionality and type of the cutting and packing problems they address. 
Each subdirectory contains a README file that provides information about the datasets, including their source, characteristics, and any relevant references.


The main subdirectories are:
- [`1d`](1d): Datasets for one-dimensional cutting and packing problems.
- [`2d_rectangular`](2d_rectangular): Datasets for two-dimensional rectangular cutting and packing problems.
- [`2d_irregular`](2d_irregular): Datasets for two-dimensional irregular cutting and packing problems.
- [`3d_rectangular`](3d_rectangular): Datasets for three-dimensional rectangular cutting and packing problems.
- [`3d_irregular`](3d_irregular): Datasets for three-dimensional irregular cutting and packing problems.
- [`misc`](misc): Miscellaneous datasets that do not fit into the above categories.


## Contribute

As this is a community-driven resource, contributions are welcome!

### New Datasets

To add a dataset, please [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and add your dataset to the relevant subdirectory.
Ensure a reference to any accompanying publication (including DOI) is added to the README file of that subdirectory.

When the changes are ready, please [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for review.

### Corrections and Improvements

We are aware that for some datasets, the descriptions and/or files may be incomplete or messy. 
If you notice any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request with the necessary changes.
