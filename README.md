# Academic Cutting & Packing Datasets from the ESICUP community
This repository contains a collection of datasets for academic research in cutting and packing problems. The datasets are intended to facilitate benchmarking and comparison of different algorithms and approaches.

> [!NOTE]
> This resource was previously hosted at [https://github.com/ESICUP/datasets](https://github.com/ESICUP/datasets), but migrated to GitHub to improve maintainability and accessibility.

### Structure

The datasets are organized into subdirectories based on the dimensionality and type of the cutting and packing problems they address. 
Each subdirectory contains a README file that provides information about the datasets, including their source, characteristics, and any relevant references.

### Contribute

We welcome contributions from the academic community.
If you want to upload a dataset, please [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and add your dataset to the relevant subdirectory.
Ensure a reference to any accompanying publication (including DOI) is added to the README file of that subdirectory.

When the changes are ready, please [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for review.
