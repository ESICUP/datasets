These instances are taken from the paper
"A New Exact Algorithm for General Orthogonal D-Dimensional Knapsack Problems", 1997,
by Sándor P. Fekete and Jörg Schepers.

The format of these data files is:
number of pieces (m)
length, width for the stock rectangle
for each piece i (i=1,...,m): length, width, maximum number
of pieces of that type that can be cut from the stock
rectangle, value of the piece

The optimal solution values for each of these instances is given in the above paper.
