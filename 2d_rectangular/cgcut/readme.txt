Description: 
2D Constrained guillotine cutting data sets (CGCUT) from CHRISTOFIDES/WHITLOCK (1977)
These data files are the 3 test problems from Table 2 of Christofides (1977) 30-44. 
The value of the optimal solution for each of these data files is given in the paper.
(Data sets: cgcut1, cgcut2, cgcut3)
