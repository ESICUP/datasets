Description: 
2D Rectangular Strip Packing Problems (T and N) from HOPPER (2000)
This set of guillotineable and non-guillotineable test problems with known optima was constructed with the problem generators described in Hopper (2000). 
The problem size lies between 17 and 199 items.
(Data sets: t1a, ..., t1e, t2a, ..., t2e, t3a, ..., t3e, t4a, ..., t4e, t5a, ..., t5e, t6a, ..., t6e, t7a, ..., 
t7e, n1a, ..., n1e, n2a, ..., n2e, n3a, ..., n3e, n4a, ..., n4e, n5a, ..., n5e, n6a, ..., n6e, n7a, ..., n7e).
