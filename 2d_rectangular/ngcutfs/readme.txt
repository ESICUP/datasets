Description: 
2D Constrained non-guillotine cutting data sets (NGCUTFS) from FEKETE/SCHPERS (????)
Files ngcutfs1, ngcutfs2 and ngcutfs3 contain the Fekete and Schepers problems (types I, II and III respectively) 
solved in the working paper. Each file has 210 test problems. (Data sets: ngcutfs1, ngcutfs2, ngcutfs3)
