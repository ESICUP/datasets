Description: 
2D Rectangular Bin Packing Problems (M) from HOPPER/TURTON (2002)
This file contains three problem categories that consist of 100 and 150 rectangles. 
The object set contains between 16 and 20 bins of different size. 
The problems are constructed such that the total area of the rectangles in each category is similar. 
The optimum solutions are not known.
(Data sets: m1a, ..., m1e, m2a, ..., m2e, m3a, ..., m3e)
