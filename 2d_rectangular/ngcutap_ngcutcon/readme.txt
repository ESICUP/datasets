Description: 
2D Constrained non-guillotine cutting data sets (NGCUTAP) from BEASLEY (working paper)
File ngcutap contains 21 problems for which optimal solutions are known and which were solved in the above working paper. 
The first 12 of these test problems correspond to the problems solved in Table 1 of Beasley (1985).
File ngcutcon contains 21 test problems solved in the above working paper where the minimum number of pieces that must 
be cut from the stock rectangle is sometimes > 0.
(Data sets: ngcutap1, ngcutap2, ..., ngcutap21, ngcutcon1, ngcutcon2, ..., ngcutcon21)
