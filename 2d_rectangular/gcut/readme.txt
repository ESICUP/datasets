Description: 
2D Unconstrained guillotine cutting data sets (GCUT) from BEASLEY (1985)
These data files are the 12 test problems from Table 1 of Beasley (1985) together with the single test problem from Table 2 of that paper. 
The value of the optimal solution for the first twelve problems is given in the above paper. 
The value of the optimal solution for the last problem is not known at present.
(Data: gcut1, gcut2, ..., gcut13)
