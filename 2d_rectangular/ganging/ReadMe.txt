Description: 
This file explains the file format of the files in this directory.  All numbers are integers, comma is used as the delimiter.  
The first row gives the width and heigth of the sheet.  Each subsequent row gives the width , height , amount of a job to be placed on the sheet.  In short, the idea is to place copies of each job with at least one copy of each job on the sheet.  Once completed the sheet will then be printed multiple times until there are enough copies of each job.  The goal is to minimize the number of copies of the sheet that must be printed.
