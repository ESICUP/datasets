    - The objective is to minimize trim loss when producing and cutting master reels of paper into ordered reels and sheets.

- [`dualdistribution`](dualdistribution)
   - 1D Bin Packing problem set used in the paper: Burke E. K., Hyde M. R. and Kendall G. (2010). “Providing a Memory Mechanism to Enhance the Evolutionary Design of Heuristics”. In Proceedings of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (CEC 2010). July 18-23 2010, Barcelona, Spain, pp 3883–3890. 
   - The item sizes are drawn from gaussian distributions, and some are taken from two such distributions.

- [`falkenauer`](falkenauer) 
    - 1D Bin-Packing Problems from FALKENAUER (1996) (Data sets: binpack1, binpack2, binpack3, binpack4, binpack5, binpack6, binpack7, binpack8)

- [`hard28`](hard28)
    - The 28 VERY hard BPP instances of J. Schoenfield (with m from 140 to 200). Test results with an LP-based approach in (Data sets: hard28)

- [`PatternReductionTestInstances`](PatternReductionTestInstances)
    - These instances are solutions to the 1D-CSP and are intended to provide a test-bed to evaluate pattern reduction heuristics, i.e. whether the solution be transformed into another with fewer patterns, but the same run length, order allocation and waste.
