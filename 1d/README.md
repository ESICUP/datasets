## 1D

- [`CorreiaMH_ASC`](CorreiaMH_ASC) 
    - These files are the test problems used in the paper Correia, Oliveira and Ferreira (2003). The objective is to minimize trim loss when producing and cutting master reels of paper into ordered reels and sheets.

- [`dualdistribution`](dualdistribution)
   - 1D Bin Packing problem set used in the paper: Burke E. K., Hyde M. R. and Kendall G. (2010). “Providing a Memory Mechanism to Enhance the Evolutionary Design of Heuristics”. In Proceedings of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (CEC 2010). July 18-23 2010, Barcelona, Spain, pp 3883–3890. The item sizes are drawn from gaussian distributions, and some are taken from two such distributions.

- [`falkenauer`](falkenauer) 
    - 1D Bin-Packing Problems from FALKENAUER (1996) (Data sets: binpack1, binpack2, binpack3, binpack4, binpack5, binpack6, binpack7, binpack8)

- [`hard28`](hard28)
    - The 28 VERY hard BPP instances of J. Schoenfield (with m from 140 to 200). Test results with an LP-based approach in (Data sets: hard28)

- [`PatternReductionTestInstances`](PatternReductionTestInstances)
    - These instances are solutions to the 1D-CSP and are intended to provide a test-bed to evaluate pattern reduction heuristics, i.e. whether the solution be transformed into another with fewer patterns, but the same run length, order allocation and waste. 
    - See for example Foerster, H., & Wascher, G. (2000). Pattern reduction in one-dimensional cutting stock problems. International Journal of Production Research, 1657-1676.

- [`scholl`](scholl)
    - 1D Bin-Packing Problems from SCHOLL/KLEIN/JUERGENS (1997) (Data sets: bin1data, bin2data, bin3data)

- [`schwerin`](schwerin)
    - 1D Bin-Packing Problems from SCHWERIN/WAESCHER (1998) (Files: sch_wae1, sch_wae2)

- [`waescher`](waescher)
    - 1D Bin-Packing Problems from WAESCHER/GAU (1996) (Files: wae_gau1, wae_gau2)
